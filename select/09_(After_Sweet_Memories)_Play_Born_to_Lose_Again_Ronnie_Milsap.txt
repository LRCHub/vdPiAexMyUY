(AFTER SWEET MEMORIES) PLAY BORN TO LOSE AGAIN
Writer Kent M. Robbins

Pardon me I'm just another lonely fool
And I know the band is tired it's half past two
But would you play one last request for an old friend
After Sweet Memories play Born To Lose again
After Sweet Memories would you play Born To Lose again
I'm here most every night until the music ends
I know you know my story I hear it now and then
So after Sweet Memories play Born To Lose again
I know the waitress here she seats me near the band
She brings me scotch'n soda and her eyes understand
Your hard day's night is ending but mine will soon begin
So after Sweet Memories play Born To Lose again
After Sweet Memories would you play Born To Lose again...
So after Sweet Memories play Born To Lose again
